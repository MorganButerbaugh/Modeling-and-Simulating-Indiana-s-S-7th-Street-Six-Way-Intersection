To enhance transportation flow at street intersections, it is imperative to establish
 proper coordination among the signals and traffic lights that manage the flow of traffic
 in multiple directions. We propose a study that presents a methodology to assess
 impractical traffic patterns at a six-way intersection in Indiana, causing unpredictable
 wait times and delays in arrival times for local destinations and to determine optimal
 signal timings to minimize traffic congestion. In representing this system as close to
 reality, we will compile data to evaluate how the system currently is. This will include
 collecting such data as vehicle and pedestrian count at this intersection, at different
 time cycles, and data shown by google maps. Information relevant to the arrival and
 vehicles in that area will be collected and proceeded by finding the best probability
 distribution of the data according to the type of vehicle and route where it entered. For
 the simulation model, our goal is to find the best random distribution associated with
 the time between the arrival of the vehicles in the rush hour segment of analysis using
 the goodness of fit test. We aim to optimize the model and determine the necessity
 of all streets for travel, identifying which turning lanes are necessary, and evaluating
 the effectiveness of different traffic control strategies and infrastructure improvements,
 that will help in achieving our objective.
